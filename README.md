## Machine Learning Operations using GitHub Actions with automated deployment to Kubernetes clusters.

## <img src="images/3d-ball-icon/orange-3d-ball.png" width="35" /> B. Project Objectives

In this project, I want to meet the following objectives: 
-   To use open-source tool such as GitHub Actions, to create a Continuous Integration/Continous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that automates the life cycle processes for the Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) domain.
-   To automate the CD process using ArgoCD, which is an open-source tool for automatic application deployment.
-   To deploy the ML model to managed Kubernetes services offered by the 3 major cloud providers, i.e.:
    -   Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) of Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    -   Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) of Microsoft Azure
    -   Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) of Google Cloud Platform

Step-by-step instructions are provided at the end of each section for your ease of reference of the project details.

### D1. MLOps CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions has been a very successful automation tool used by software developers to automate the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) from development stage right through to the deployment stage.

#### _Figure D1. DevOps CI/CD pipeline (Software Engineering) versus MLOps CI/CD pipeline (Machine Learning)_
<img src="images/d1-devops-cicd-pipeline.png" width="400" /> <img src="images/d1-mlops-cicd-pipeline.png" width="380" />

It can be seen from the above images there are subtle differences in the 2 domains but these processes can all be automated using GitHub Actions.

#### _Figure D2. Different roles involved in MLOps workflow._
<img src="images/d1-mlops-different-roles-involved-in-workflow.png" width="600" /><br>

Note the parties involved in the MLOps processes are: Data Engineers, Data Scientists, MLOps Engineers, Web Developers and Operations Support.

The equivalent of the DevOps Engineers are the MLOps Engineers in the ML domain. Whereas DevOps Engineers need to understand SDLC principles and concepts at high-level to be able to collaborate with Software Developers, MLOps Engineers need to understand data science principles and concepts at high-level to be able to work with Data Scientists.

#### _Figure D3. MLOps workflow using GitHub Actions._
<img src="images/d1-mlops-github-action-workflow.png" width="600" /><br>

In the ML domain, the actual development or the training/fine-tuning of the program codes is usually done by a data scientist. Hence, the Trunk-based development approach (versus the more complex variation using Feature branching) is more suitable as the branching strategy for MLOps workflow.

Reference: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-trunk-based-development/

In the MLOps workflow, there are mainly 3 events that will trigger the MLOps pipeline into action:

1.  __Push event at dev branch__ (Indicated by (5))

    -  The trained ML model as well as training results will be saved as artifacts for audit trail purpose.
    -   Note that, by default, the artifacts and log files generated by workflows are retained for 90 days (for public repositories) and 400 days (for private repositories) before they are automatically deleted. For longer term archival, consider using the artifact repositories offered by the cloud providers.

2.  __Pull request from dev branch to main branch__ (Indicated by (6), (7))

    -   New pull requests to merge changes from dev to the main branch are subjected to approval by a manager/senior data scientist who will validate and assess the ML model training results, which are available as GitHub artifacts.
    -   Upon acceptance of the test results and approval of the pull request, the changes and the latest source codes are merged back to the main branch.
    -   The ML model file (one of the files in the GitHub artifacts) will be used to build the Docker image and tagged as ml-model:latest (note that this is a developer build and not to be released to production environment) and is pushed to the DockerHub.
    -   If the pull request is rejected for some reasons, the pending CI workflow/job will be cancelled by GitHub Actions and no ml-model:latest will be pushed to the DockerHub.

3.  __Release event on the main branch with vx.x.x semantic version tag__ (Indicated by (8))

    -   This is a step that requires due diligence on the testing/QA team to schedule the deployment of the release version of the ML model to the production environment.
    -   Upon creation of the release tag, the event will trigger the CD process:
        -   Push to DockerHub with 2 images with respective tag of latest and vx.x.x.
        -   Update the image tag version in the ArgoCD application config repository to the new release version vx.x.x.
        -   Deployment of the release version vx.x.x of the ML model to the test/dev system is auto-sync via ArgoCD UI or CLI.
        -   Deployment of the release version vx.x.x of the ML model to the production system is manually synchronised via ArgoCD UI or CLI.
    -   If the release is rejected for some reasons, the pending CD workflow/job will be cancelled by GitHub Actions.

3.  __Release event on the main branch with vx.x.x semantic version tag__

    -   To create a new tag, use the `git tag` command and specify the tag name that you want to create.
        ```
        git tag <tag_name>
        ```
        For example, if you want to create a new tag v1.0.0 as the new release version, then type:
        ```
        git tag v1.0.0
        ```
    -   Use the `git tag` command again without specifying the <tag_name> to list the existing tags available in the repository.
        ```
        git tag

        v1.0.0
        ```

### D2. Containerisation <img src="images/logo/d2-docker-logo.png" width="60" /> And Microservices <img src="images/logo/d2-microservices-logo.png" width="60" />

We will containerise the model file created in the preceding step to a Docker image.

Containerisation is one of the cloud-native technologies that we should always exploit, so that our application (i.e. our ML model) is portable, deployable and easily designed for scalability.

In addition to containerising our ML Model, we have also implemented industrial standard protocol using the REST API so that our image can be easily accessed via the HTTP GET and POST method using our internet browser.

<XXXdetails><summary><code style="color: lightgreen">Containerisation And Microservices Testing Instructions</code></summary>

1.  Pre-requisites For Containerisation And Microservices Testing Instructions:
    - |S/N|Required software|Version|
      |---|-----------------|-------|
      | 1 | Postman sign-in account||
      |||

2.  Use Postman to test the GET method.

    <img src="images/d2-containerisation-detail-02-test-get-using-postman.png" width="600" />

3.  Use Postman to test the POST method.

    <img src="images/d2-containerisation-detail-03-test-post-using-postman.png" width="600" />
</details>

### D3. Kubernetes <img src="images/logo/d3-kubernetes-logo.png" width="60" />

We have chosen to use Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) which is the managed Kubernetes services of Amazon Web Services' (AWS) as the deployment platform.

EKS is the managed Kubernetes services of Amazon Web Services' (AWS) which offers high-availability, scalability and resiliency for our deployed applications.

The EKS cluster is provisioned using Terraform, which is an open-source technology to allow us to deploy infrastructure using codes.

<XXXdetails><summary><code style="color: lightgreen">Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Deployment Instructions</code></summary>

1.  Pre-requisites For EKS Deployment Instructions:
    - |S/N|Required software|Version|
      |---|-----------------|-------|
      | 1 | terraform       |v1.8.5 or later.|
      | 2 | kubectl         |v1.30.2 or later.|
      | 3 | AWS account with permission to provision resources.||
      | 4 | AWS credentials setup in local machine.||
      |||

2.  Navigate to the folder terraform/aws:

    <img src="images/d3-eks-detail/d3-eks-detail-02-terraform-aws-folder-structure.png" width="600" />

3.  Run the `terraform init` command to initialise and download any plugins.

    <img src="images/d3-eks-detail/d3-eks-detail-03-terraform-init.png" width="600" />

4.  Run the `terraform apply` command with the argument `-var-file=prod.tfvars` and press the `Enter` key.
    ```
    terraform apply -var-file=prod.tfvars
    ```
    <img src="images/d3-eks-detail/d3-eks-detail-04-terraform-apply-prod.png" width="600" />

    Note that the command will provision the infrastructures (VPC, Network, Firewalls, Internet Gateway, EC2, etc) for the production environment. Please use the dev.tfvars to setup the development/testing environment, if required, in a separate run.
    ```
    terraform apply -var-file=dev.tfvars
    ```

5.  Upon prompted by the system, type `yes` and then press the `Enter` key:

    <img src="images/d3-eks-detail/d3-eks-detail-05-terraform-apply-yes.png" width="600" />

6.  Please wait for up to 20 minutes for the Terraform to provision the EKS cluster in AWS.

    <img src="images/d3-eks-detail/d3-eks-detail-06-terraform-apply-running.png" width="600" />

7.  Upon completion of the EKS cluster, you should be able to see the information about the cluster:

    <img src="images/d3-eks-detail/d3-eks-detail-07-terraform-apply-output-prod.png" width="600" /><br>

    <img src="images/d3-eks-detail/d3-eks-detail-07-terraform-apply-output-dev.png" width="600" />

8.  Please note down the details shown in the preceding step because the information is required in section D4 for installing the ArgoCD.

9.  After the cluster is created successfully, you need to configure your local machine to access to it.
    For EKS, the command is:
    ```
    aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <REGION-CODE> --name <CLUSTER_NAME>
    ```
    For prod environment:
    ```
    Outputs:

    eks_cluster_endpoint = "https://0B7D242CD8556B4E1F622308C953BCE8.gr7.us-east-1.eks.amazonaws.com"
    eks_cluster_name = "eks-cluster-prod" <<<<<< Need this for next step.
    eks_cluster_region = "us-east-1" <<<<<< Need this for next step.
    eks_cluster_security_group_id = "sg-0d91e4c82b2a10693"
    eks_cluster_version = "1.29"
    kubeconfig_command = "aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 --name eks-cluster-prod"
    ```
    For dev environment:
    ```
    Outputs:

    eks_cluster_endpoint = "https://0B7D242CD8556B4E1F622308C953BCE8.gr7.us-east-1.eks.amazonaws.com"
    eks_cluster_name = "eks-cluster-dev" <<<<<< Need this for next step.
    eks_cluster_region = "us-east-1" <<<<<< Need this for next step.
    eks_cluster_security_group_id = "sg-0d91e4c82b2a10693"
    eks_cluster_version = "1.29"
    kubeconfig_command = "aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 --name eks-cluster-dev"
    ```

10. Run the following command to update the kubectl configuration file (Located at ~/.kube/config), so that your local machine is configured to access the newly created EKS cluster.

    For prod environment:
    ```
    aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 --name eks-cluster-prod
    ```
    <img src="images/d3-eks-detail/d3-eks-detail-08-update-kubeconfig-prod.png" width="600" /><br>

    For dev environment:
    ```
    aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 --name eks-cluster-dev
    ```
    <img src="images/d3-eks-detail/d3-eks-detail-08-update-kubeconfig-dev.png" width="600" />

11. Run some commands using kubectl to verify you are able to access the cluster.
    ```
    kubectl get namespaces
    kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
    kubectl cluster-info
    ```
    <img src="images/d3-eks-detail/d3-eks-detail-09-kubectl-test-commands.png" width="600" /><br>

    <img src="images/d3-eks-detail/d3-eks-detail-10-kubectl-cluster-info.png" width="600" />

12. Before we proceed to deploy the resources to the cluster, let us rename the name of the context to a shorter name.
    ```
    kubectl get-contexts
    ```
    <img src="images/d3-eks-detail/d3-eks-detail-11-kubectl-get-contexts.png" width="600" /><br>

    ```
    kubectl rename-context arn:aws:eks:us-east-1:266109346134:cluster/eks-cluster-prod
    ```
    <img src="images/d3-eks-detail/d3-eks-detail-12-kubectl-rename-context.png" width="600" /><br>

    <img src="images/d3-eks-detail/d3-eks-detail-13-kubectl-renamed-context.png" width="600" />

13. Navigate to the folder __pred-main/overlays/prod__ and run the below command:
    ```
    kustomize build . | kubectl apply -f -
    ```
    <img src="images/d3-eks-detail/d3-eks-detail-14-kustomize-build.png" width="600" />

14. Please wait for few minutes till all the pods are in the Running status. Use the below command to check the status of the pods.
    ```
    kubectl get pods -A
    ```
    <img src="images/d3-eks-detail/d3-eks-detail-15-one-pod-still-pending.png" width="600" />

15. You are ready to proceed to setup the ArgoCD described in section D4.

16. Please remember to delete the resources that you deployed in the preceding steps if the resources are no longer required:
    ```
    terraform destroy -var-file=prod.tfvars
    ```
    <img src="images/d3-eks-detail/d3-eks-detail-16-terraform-destroy-yes.png" width="600" /><br>

    terraform apply -var-file=dev.tfvars
    ```

5.  Upon prompted by the system, type `yes` and then press the `Enter` key:

    <img src="images/d3-aks-detail/d3-aks-detail-05-terraform-apply-yes.png" width="600" />

6.  Please wait for up to 10 minutes for the Terraform to provision the AKS cluster in Azure.

    <img src="images/d3-aks-detail/d3-aks-detail-06-terraform-apply-running.png" width="600" />

7.  Upon completion of the AKS cluster, you should be able to see the information about the cluster:

    <img src="images/d3-aks-detail/d3-aks-detail-07-terraform-apply-output-prod.png" width="600" /><br>

    <img src="images/d3-aks-detail/d3-aks-detail-07-terraform-apply-output-dev.png" width="600" />

8.  Please note down the details shown in the preceding step because the information is required in section D4 for installing the ArgoCD.

9.  After the cluster is created successfully, you need to configure your local machine to access to it.
    For AKS, the command is:
    ```
    az aks get-credentials --resource-group <RESOURCE-GROUP> --name <CLUSTER_NAME>
    ```
    For prod environment:
    ```
    Outputs:

    aks_cluster_location = "westus2"
    aks_cluster_name = "aks-cluster-prod" <<<<<< Need this for next step.
    aks_cluster_resource_group_name = "aks-resource-group-rg" <<<<<< Need this for next step.
    aks_cluster_version = "1.29"
    kubeconfig_command = "az aks get-credentials --resource-group aks-resource-group-rg --name aks-cluster-prod"
    ```
    For dev environment:
    ```
    Outputs:

    aks_cluster_location = "westus2"
    aks_cluster_name = "aks-cluster-dev" <<<<<< Need this for next step.
    aks_cluster_resource_group_name = "aks-resource-group-rg" a<<<<<< Need this for next step.
    aks_cluster_version = "1.29"
    kubeconfig_command = "az aks get-credentials --resource-group aks-resource-group-rg --name aks-cluster-dev"
    ```

10. Run the following command to update the kubectl configuration file (Located at ~/.kube/config), so that your local machine is configured to access the newly created EKS cluster.

    For prod environment:
    ```
    az aks get-credentials --resource-group aks-resource-group-rg --name aks-cluster-prod
    ```
    <img src="images/d3-aks-detail/d3-aks-detail-08-update-kubeconfig-prod.png" width="600" /><br>

    For dev environment:
    ```
    az aks get-credentials --resource-group aks-resource-group-rg --name aks-cluster-dev
    ```
    <img src="images/d3-aks-detail/d3-aks-detail-08-update-kubeconfig-dev.png" width="600" />

11. Run some commands using kubectl to verify you are able to access the cluster.
    ```
    kubectl get namespaces
    kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
    kubectl cluster-info
    ```

12. Navigate to the folder __pred-main/overlays/prod__ and run the below command:
    ```
    kustomize build . | kubectl apply -f -
    ```
    <img src="images/d3-aks-detail/d3-aks-detail-11-kustomize-build.png" width="600" />

13. Please wait for few minutes till all the pods are in the Running status. Use the below command to check the status of the pods.
    ```
    kubectl get pods -A
    ```
    <img src="images/d3-aks-detail/d3-aks-detail-12-all-pod-running.png" width="600" />

14. You are ready to proceed to setup the ArgoCD described in section D4.

15. Please remember to delete the resources that you deployed in the preceding steps if the resources are no longer required:
    ```
    terraform destroy -var-file=prod.tfvars
    ```

### D4. ArgoCD <img src="images/logo/d4-argocd-logo.png" width="60" />

After deployment of our ML model as an application in the Kubernetes cluster, we make use of ArgoCD to automate the continuous deployment pipeline.

ArgoCD is a declarative GitOps-based continuous deployment tool for Kubernetes. It helps us to deploy and manage applications on Kubernetes clusters in an automated, reliable and repeatable way. It does this by continuously monitoring the live state of the applications in a cluster and compares the state against the desired state defined in the GitHub repository.

Whenever a developer pushes changes to the GitHub repository, ArgoCD will detect the changes and synchronise them to the Kubernetes.

To enable GitOps to work, it is a best practice to have 2 repositories. One for the application source codes and another one for the configuration codes. The configuration codes define the assets in the Kubernetes cluster such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMap, etc. Whenever the configuration codes are updated, ArgoCD will kick in and synchronise the live versus desired states so that they are the same eventually.

However, ArgoCD is only a continuous deployment (CD) tool and we still require a pipeline for continuous integration (CI) that will test and build our application.

<img src="images/d4-argocd-automated-cd-workflow-temp.png" width="600" /><br>

<img src="images/d4-argocd-detail-argocd-image-updater_temp.png" width="600" />

When a developer updates the application source codes, he will test and then build an image which will be pushed to a container repository. The CI pipeline will the trigger updates to the configuration repository (e.g. update the image version) which will cause ArgoCD to synchronise.

GitOps using ArgoCD has these benefits:
- It has the ability to enable Disaster Recovery. In DevOps world, we do not back things up anymore but recreate them instead. If we lose a Kubernetes cluster, we can just bootstrap a new cluster and point the new ArgoCD deployments to the configuration repository. Since everything is defined in codes, ArgoCD will bring up the new cluster to the desired state and we are back in business.
- It has the ability to orchestrate deployments to multiple Kubernetes clusters. ArgoCD is not bound to a single Kubernetes cluster. We can have ArgoCD installed on one cluster controlling the configurations of the other clusters. If any of these clusters were to fail, ArgoCD should be able to bring them back. In addition, if we were to lose the cluster where ArgoCD is installed, it would also be recoverable as the configuration of ArgoCD can be stored as YAML file.
- The applications deployed in the Kubernetes clusters are always synchronised with the single source of truth (i.e. the source GitHub repositories).
- We can adopt security best practice to grant access only to those who are responsible for supporting the CD pipeline.
- We can implement blue/green deployment and/or canary deployment with ease.
- We can always rollback to the previous working version should the new version is not stable.

1.  Pre-requisites For ArgoCD Installation (Using Manifest) Instructions:
    - |S/N|Required software|Version|
      |---|-----------------|-------|
      | 1 | kubectl         |v1.30.2 or later.|
      | 2 | kustomize       |v5.3.0 or later.|
      | 3 | openssl         |3.3.0 or later.|
      | 4 | A Kubernetes cluster installed and configured in .kube/config.||
      |||

2.  Run the following command to create the argocd namespace.
    ```
    kubectl create namespace argocd
    ```
    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-02-create-namespace.png" width="600" />

3.  Apply the __install.yaml__ manifest file to install ArgoCD.
    ```
    kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
    ```
    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-03-install-argocd.png" width="600" /><br>

    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-04-install-argocd-2.png" width="600" />

4.  Apply the __install.yaml__ manifest file to install ArgoCD Image Updater. SKIP THIS STEP. KIV
    ```
    kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/stable/manifests/install.yaml
    ```
    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-05-install-argocd-image-updater.png" width="600" /><br>

5.  Use this command to verify the ArgoCD installation.

    kubectl get all --namespace argocd
    ```
    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-06-verify-installation.png" width="600" />

    Quite a lot of components are required for ArgoCD to function properly.

6. We can access ArgoCD via its Graphical User Interface (GUI). But we need to use a mechanism called “port-forwarding” on the service called service/argocd-server (which is listening on port 80 and 443). By-pass the certificate check, if necessary.
    ```
    kubectl get services -n argocd
    kubectl port-forward service/argocd-server --namespace argocd 8080:443
    ```
    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-07-port-forwarding-443-to-8080.png" width="600" />

7. Run the following command to get the initial password of ArgoCD. You will need it to login
    to the ArgoCD GUI.
    ```
    kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d
    ```
    ```
    kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}"
    Ti1pLUhJaGM3NkU4cUpOUw==

    echo Ti1pLUhJaGM3NkU4cUpOUw== | openssl base64 -d

<XXXdetails><summary><code style="color: lightgreen">ArgoCD To Manage Multiple Kubernetes Clusters Instructions</code></summary>

1.  With the 3 Kubernetes clusters provisioned at the respective cloud providers, we are now ready to setup ArgoCD to manage Kubernetes clusters in a multi-cloud setting.

2.  Here are the details of the 3 clusters provisioned at the local machine:
    - |S/N|Kubernetes|Context         |Namespace|Remarks                                  |
      |---|----------|----------------|---------|-----------------------------------------|
      | 1 | EKS      |eks-cluster-prod| prod    |                                         |
      | 2 | AKS      |aks-cluster-prod| prod    |This the context with ArgoCD installed.  |
      | 3 | GKE      |gke-cluster-prod| prod    |                                         |
      ||||

3.  Check the context in kubeconfig by executing the following command:
    ```
    kubectl config get-contexts
    ```
    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-20-get-contexts.png" width="600" />

    Note that for EKS or GKE, the original namespace may be too long when generated by Terraform. If necessary, you can rename the context name using the `kubectl config rename-context` command as I showed previously in EKS installation Instructions.

    Henceforth, I assumed the contexts are called eks-cluster-prod, aks-cluster-prod and gke-cluster-prod for EKS, AKS and GKE cluster respectively.

4.  The pods details of the respective contexts for reference:
    aks-cluster-prod context with 3 pods deployed. ArgoCD is also installed in this context.

    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-21-aks-context.png" width="600" />

    eks-cluster-prod context with 3 pods deployed.

    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-22-eks-context.png" width="600" />

    gke-cluster-prod context with 3 pods deployed.

    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-23-gke-context.png" width="600" />

5.  Go to the Settings/Clusters tab.

    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-24-settings-clusters-tab.png" width="600" />

6.  To add clusters to the ArgoCD, we have to use the ArgoCD CLI tool. Hence, we have to first login to ArgoCD CLI:
    ```
    argocd login localhost:8080
    ```
    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-25-argocd-cli-login.png" width="600" />

7.  Use the following commands to add both the EKS and GKE clusters to ArgoCD:
    ```
    argocd cluster add eks-cluster-prod

    argocd cluster add gke-cluster-prod
    ```
    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-26-add-eks-cluster.png" width="600" /><br>

    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-27-add-gke-cluster.png" width="600" />

8.  Go to the ArgoCD GUI Landing Page and select Settings from the left panel and then select the Clusters tab. Verify the clusters have been added to ArgoCD:

    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-28-settings-clusters-gui.png" width="600" />

9.  You can also list the clusters using the command line:
    ```
    argocd cluster list
    ```
    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-29-show-all-clusters-cli.png" width="600" />

10. After adding these clusters to ArgoCD, we need to create applications (one application per cluster) within ArgoCD to tell ArgoCD which folder stores the configuration repository so that it knows the folder to monitor for changes made.

11. Within the ArgoCD GUI, click <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-12-argocd-new-app.png" width="60" /> and enter the following details for EKS cluster:
    -   GENERAL:

            -   moonysun1314/ml-model
            -   v1.0.0

13. Up to this point, you have already setup ArgoCD to monitor the following folder(s) for changes:
    -   pred-main/overlays/prod

    Any changes made to the yaml files within this folder (as well as the base folder) will be detected by ArgoCD which will automatically synchronise the 3 applications you configured to match the new states/changes.

14. For demonstration purpose, let us change the number of replicas in the base/deployment.yaml file from 3 to 5. Please change this while you are in the dev branch.

    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-31-change-replica-3-to-5.png" width="600" />

15. Git commit the changes made in step 14 and then create a pull request in GitHub GUI to merge with the main branch.

    INSERT 3 SCREENSHOTS OF GITHUB PULL REQUEST KIV.

    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-34-github-action-pull-request-2.png" width="600" />

16. Observe the 3 ArgoCD applications. Please wait for up to 3 minutes for ArgoCD to detect the changes made in step 11.

    INSERT SCREENSHOT TO SHOW ARGOCD SYNCHRONISING APPLICATION.
    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-35-show-applications-after-sync.png" width="600" />

    You can see ArgoCD is able to detect the change in the application configuration repository (i.e. pred-main/overlays/prod and also the parent folder at pred-main/base) and synchronise all the clusters to show 5 pods per cluster.

<XXXdetails><summary><code style="color: red">ArgoCD Image Updater Usage Instructions (Work-In-Progress)</code></summary>

21. In the preceding steps at 4 and 5, we have installed ArgoCD Image Updater (ArgoCD IU). Additional steps are required to configure the software so that it has the credentials to track any updates in the Image Registry (i.e. DockerHub). Here we will setup the credentials for the ArgoCD IU to access to public repositories only.

22. First, we create a Kubernetes Secret representing the Git credentials, so the updated manifests can be pushed to the repository. The secret must be at the Argo CD namespace and, in this case, we name it git-creds.
    ```
    kubectl -n argocd create secret generic git-creds --from-literal=username=sunnymoon1314 --from-literal=password=<git_password_or_token>
    ```
    Replace <git_password_or_token> by the GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) which is in the form ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.

23. Add an Application manifest annotated with ArgoCD IU annotations.

    <img src="images/d4-argocd-detail/d4-argocd-detail-18-application-annotation-yaml.png" width="600" />

24. Apply the manifest to deploy the application first version and enable ArgoCD IU to update the repository when a new image is pushed to the container registry:
    ```
    cd C:\Users\bunny\OneDrive\OneDrive_AddOn\github\ce5-group5-capstone\pred-main\base

    kubectl apply -f pred-main-app.yaml
    ```

25. At this point, version 1.0.1 is up and running in the pred-main namespace. Let us generate a new image version to validate that the new image is in the repository.

26. To simplify the process, we will tag the image with version 1.1.0 as it was a new one.

27. Wait for about two minutes until the change is detected and the controller triggers the repository update. We can use the `kubectl logs` command to validate the triggering process.
    ```
    kubectl logs argocd-image-updater-59c45cbc5c-kjjtp -f -n argocd
    ```
    ```
    ...
    time="2022-06-20T21:19:05Z" level=info msg="Setting new image to
    moonysun1314/ml-model:1.1.0" alias=myalias application=pred-main-app
    image_name=moonysun1314/ml-model image_tag=1.0.0 registry=docker.io
    time="2022-06-20T21:19:05Z" level=info msg="Successfully updated image
    'moonysun1314/ml-model:1.0.0' to 'moonysun1314/ml-model:1.1.0', but
    pending spec update (dry run=false)" alias=myalias application=pred-main-app
    image_name=moonysun1314/ml-model image_tag=1.0.0 registry=docker.io
    time="2022-06-20T21:19:05Z" level=info msg="Committing 1 parameter update(s)
    for application pred-main-app" application=pred-main-app
    ...
    ```

XX. Release a new version of the ML model by creating a new tag (say v1.0.1) in GitHub and then approve and deploy the new version to the prod environment. You should be able to see ArgoCD synchronise the version from v1.0.0 to v1.0.1.

## <img src="images/3d-ball-icon/blue-3d-ball.png" width="35" /> E. Summary Of Lessons Learnt And Challenges Faced

Through the hands-on experience while implementing this project, I have learnt the following concepts:
-   CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
-   Containerisation: Any software, databases, ML models, can be containerised and run as Docker containers!!!
-   Kubernetes: This is a very versatile container orchestration platform that has auto-healing capability. The story does not end here because the functionalities of Kubernetes can be enhanced and extended via the mechanism called Custom Resource Definitions.
-   Infrastructure-as-codes using Terraform. It is so effortless to provision infrastructures and Kubernetes clusters using IaC.

Some of the challenges I faced:

-   On __GitHub Actions__: This is a tool for coders!!! There are so many contributions from the community and sometimes I was lost as to which actions should be the appropriate one to use.
-   On __ArgoCD__: It was quite impossible to trial and error on certain tools (such as ArgoCD) if you do not understand some of the basic concepts such as Helm charts and Kustomize. So I had to take a few steps back to learn the basics before the actual hands-on using ArgoCD.
-   On __Terraform__: Some of the attributes were only introduced in new versions of the Terraform provider. For example, deletion_protection must be explicitly set to false in order to destroy the resources. I was panicked because I was not able to destroy the resources using `terraform destroy` and that will mean cost incurred for the running resources. Luckily I found the solution from stackoverflow.com that you can update deletion_protectio by editing the terraform state file directly!!!

Most of the other issues I encountered could be resolved by browsing through the suggestions and answers provided by gurus in the stackoverflow.com channel as well as via their blog posts.

## <img src="images/3d-ball-icon/indigo-3d-ball.png" width="35" /> E. Suggestions For Future Work

Due to time constraint, I am not able to implement few topics which were original in the project plan (ArgoCD Image Updater and monitoring tools such as Prometheus).

There are still a lot of room for improvements and I will continue the learning journey to get more exposure and experience via hands-on and collaboration with other experts in the area of cloud technologies.

There are some areas which I would like to continue to explore in the near future:
-   To research and better understand the other options available for automating MLOps workflow. There are a lot of open-source MLOps workflow platforms that I have not explored such as:
    -   MLFlo, which is yet another open-source project tailored made for building MLOps pipeline.
    -   KubeFlow which allow us to leverage on Kubernetes clusters to perform distributed training of the ML models.
    -   Managed ML Services of Sagemaker from AWS.
    -   Data Version Control open-source platform at [Data Version Control](dvc.org) which offers lots of toolsets for building MLOps workflow.

-   To get more hands-on experience on setting up monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana, as well as monitoring tools specifically built for monitoring ML model performance. It is valuable skillset to know how to get insights to the various metrics, logs and traces for troubleshooting, optimising and monitoring the operational and performance capabilities of the various applications and microservices.

-   Tools for managing Kubernetes clusters and the microservices, such as Rancher, Consul and Istio so that we are in a better position to manage the clusters for improved observerability, streamlined traffic management and better security.

## <img src="images/3d-ball-icon/violet-3d-ball.png" width="35" /> F. References

Here are few books which I used as references to help in the preparation of this project.

Kubernetes is a very complex but yet versatile platform. The learning curve is really very steep for beginner like me.

GitOps is also a very interesting concept which helps in automating the CD workflow.

Though there are lots of YouTube channels and blog posts available in the Internet for us to refer to, yet adopting a systematic way of learning by reading books could be one of the ways to get started at your own pace.

Pleasant learning journey!!!
